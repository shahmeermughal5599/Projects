What is Js Engines

President -> Translator -> language ko Smajjh kar -> President ko btayega


we use compilers for understanding the javascript in to the browser 


Compilers

1-chrome is using v8 javascript engine
2-SpiderMonkey – The JavaScript Engine powering Mozilla Firefox
3-JavaScriptCore – Open-source JavaScript Engine developed by Apple for Safari



For Ios App we will use javascript core engine.

For Android react native will use hermes engine

Hermes is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. For many apps, using Hermes will result in improved start-up time, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size when compared to JavaScriptCore. Hermes is used by default by React Native and no additional configuration is required to enable it

when we are using the debug tool it will use chrome v8 engine
